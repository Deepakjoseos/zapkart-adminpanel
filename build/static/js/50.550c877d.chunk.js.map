Why would we need to do\n    that?  In the future a more dynamic engine will allow certain matches to be\n    ignored.  An example: if we matched say the 3rd regex in a large group but\n    decided to ignore it - we'd need to started testing again at the 4th\n    regex... but MultiRegex itself gives us no real way to do that.\n\n    So what this class creates MultiRegexs on the fly for whatever search\n    position they are needed.\n\n    NOTE: These additional MultiRegex objects are created dynamically.  For most\n    grammars most of the time we will never actually need anything more than the\n    first MultiRegex - so this shouldn't have too much overhead.\n\n    Say this is our search group, and we match regex3, but wish to ignore it.\n\n      regex1 | regex2 | regex3 | regex4 | regex5    ' ie, startAt = 0\n\n    What we need is a new MultiRegex that only includes the remaining\n    possibilities:\n\n      regex4 | regex5                               ' ie, startAt = 3\n\n    This class wraps all that complexity up in a simple API... `startAt` decides\n    where in the array of expressions to start doing the matching. It\n    auto-increments, so if a match is found at position 2, then startAt will be\n    set to 3.  If the end is reached startAt will return to 0.\n\n    MOST of the time the parser will be setting startAt manually to 0.\n  */\n  class ResumableMultiRegex {\n    constructor() {\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.rules = [];\n      // @ts-ignore\n      this.multiRegexes = [];\n      this.count = 0;\n\n      this.lastIndex = 0;\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    getMatcher(index) {\n      if (this.multiRegexes[index]) return this.multiRegexes[index];\n\n      const matcher = new MultiRegex();\n      this.rules.slice(index).forEach(([re, opts]) => matcher.addRule(re, opts));\n      matcher.compile();\n      this.multiRegexes[index] = matcher;\n      return matcher;\n    }\n\n    resumingScanAtSamePosition() {\n      return this.regexIndex !== 0;\n    }\n\n    considerAll() {\n      this.regexIndex = 0;\n    }\n\n    // @ts-ignore\n    addRule(re, opts) {\n      this.rules.push([re, opts]);\n      if (opts.type === \"begin\") this.count++;\n    }\n\n    /** @param {string} s */\n    exec(s) {\n      const m = this.getMatcher(this.regexIndex);\n      m.lastIndex = this.lastIndex;\n      let result = m.exec(s);\n\n      // The following is because we have no easy way to say \"resume scanning at the\n      // existing position but also skip the current rule ONLY\".

version appeared in the 80s, but it's still actively developed today with\n             the newest standard being Ada2012.\n*/\n\n// We try to support full Ada2012\n//\n// We highlight all appearances of types, keywords, literals (string, char, number, bool)\n// and titles (user defined function/procedure/package)\n// CSS classes are set accordingly\n//\n// Languages causing problems for language detection:\n// xml (broken by Foo : Bar type), elm (broken by Foo : Bar type), vbscript-html (broken by body keyword)\n// sql (ada default.txt has a lot of sql keywords)\n\n/** @type LanguageFn
