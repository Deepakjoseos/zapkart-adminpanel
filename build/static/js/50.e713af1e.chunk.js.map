Only one occasion now.  An end match that was\n      triggered but could not be completed.  When might this happen?  When an `endSameasBegin`\n      rule sets the end rule to a specific match.  Since the overall mode termination rule that's\n      being used to scan the text isn't recompiled that means that any match that LOOKS like\n      the end (but is not, because it is not an exact match to the beginning) will\n      end up here.  A definite end match, but when `doEndMatch` tries to \"reapply\"\n      the end rule and fails to match, we wind up here, and just silently ignore the end.\n\n      This causes no real harm other than stopping a few times too many.\n      */\n\n      modeBuffer += lexeme;\n      return lexeme.length;\n    }\n\n    const language = getLanguage(languageName);\n    if (!language) {\n      error(LANGUAGE_NOT_FOUND.replace(\"{}\", languageName));\n      throw new Error('Unknown language: \"' + languageName + '\"');\n    }\n\n    const md = compileLanguage(language, { plugins });\n    let result = '';\n    /** @type {CompiledMode} */\n    let top = continuation || md;\n    /** @type Record<string,CompiledMode> */\n    const continuations = {}; // keep continuations for sub-languages\n    const emitter = new options.__emitter(options);\n    processContinuations();\n    let modeBuffer = '';\n    let relevance = 0;\n    let index = 0;\n    let iterations = 0;\n    let resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n\n    try {\n      top.matcher.considerAll();\n\n      for (;;) {\n        iterations++;\n        if (resumeScanAtSamePosition) {\n          // only regexes not matched previously will now be\n          // considered for a potential match\n          resumeScanAtSamePosition = false;\n        } else {\n          top.matcher.considerAll();\n        }\n        top.matcher.lastIndex = index;\n\n        const match = top.matcher.exec(codeToHighlight);\n        // console.log(\"match\", match[0], match.rule && match.rule.begin)\n\n        if (!match) break;\n\n        const beforeMatch = codeToHighlight.substring(index, match.index);\n        const processedCount = processLexeme(beforeMatch, match);\n        index = match.index + processedCount;\n      }\n      processLexeme(codeToHighlight.substr(index));\n      emitter.closeAllNodes();\n      emitter.finalize();\n      result = emitter.toHTML();\n\n      return {\n        // avoid possible breakage with v10 clients expecting\n        // this to always be an integer\n        relevance: Math.floor(relevance),\n        value: result,\n        language: languageName,\n        illegal: false,\n        emitter: emitter,\n        top: top\n      };\n    } catch (err) {\n      if (err.message && err.message.includes('Illegal')) {\n        return {\n          illegal: true,\n          illegalBy: {\n            msg: err.message,\n            context: codeToHighlight.slice(index - 100, index + 100),\n            mode: err.mode\n          },\n          sofar: result,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter\n        };\n      } else if (SAFE_MODE) {\n        return {\n          illegal: false,\n          relevance: 0,\n          value: escape$1(codeToHighlight),\n          emitter: emitter,\n          language: languageName,\n          top: top,\n          errorRaised: err\n        };\n      } else {\n        throw err;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * returns a valid highlight result, without actually doing any actual work,\n   * auto highlight starts with this and it's possible for small snippets that\n   * auto-detection may not find a better match\n   * @param {string} code\n   * @returns {HighlightResult}\n   */\n  function justTextHighlightResult(code) {\n    const result = {\n      relevance: 0,\n      emitter: new options.__emitter(options),\n      value: escape$1(code),\n      illegal: false,\n      top: PLAINTEXT_LANGUAGE\n    };\n    result.emitter.addText(code);\n    return result;\n  }\n\n  /**\n  Highlighting with language detection.
